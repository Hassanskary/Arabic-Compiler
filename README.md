# Project Compiler

A Windows Forms application built with C# for compiler design and automated software analysis based on optimization of Lyapunov invariants.

## 📋 Description

This project is a compiler design application that provides tools for automated software analysis. It features a modern Windows Forms interface with multiple forms for different functionalities including parsing, extensions, and compiler operations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Form Interface**: Multiple Windows Forms for different compiler operations
- **Parser Extensions**: Custom parsing capabilities for code analysis
- **Resource Management**: Comprehensive resource handling for images and assets
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface design
- **Compiler Design Tools**: Specialized tools for compiler development

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
- **UI Framework**: Windows Forms
- **IDE**: Visual Studio
- **Platform**: Windows

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2017 or later
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- Windows Operating System

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd Compiler-Project
   ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
   ```
   ProjectCompiler.sln
   ```

3. Build the project:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` or
